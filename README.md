# sensor-falut-detection
Identifying  air pressure system is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a position to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benifits of using an APS instead of a hydralic system are the easy availability and long term sustainability of natture air.
